## Local Development
If you have MkDocs installed, you can test your guide locally by running the following command:

    mkdocs serve

This starts a local web server that you can use to view your guide. You can then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to view your guide. This is useful for testing links, images, and other formatting.
